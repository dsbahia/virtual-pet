# Virtual Pet

Real pets are great, but they do have drawbacks. They smell. Your mum might be allergic to them. Maybe you just aren't allowed one in your flat.

To solve these problems, this is a repository where we build JavaScript pets.

JavaScript pets are great. Because they're made of JavaScript, they can do literally anything, and they don't have any of the drawbacks of regular pets.

The pets we're going to make will have the following features:

- A name 📛
- They can get older 👵
- As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit 🏋️
- We can walk our pet to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️
- We can feed our pet to decrease it's hunger. 🍕
- We can talk to our pet to see if it needs feeding or walking 🚶
- If our pet gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀
- If our pet gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢

## Would you like to play with my pet?

Open Node REPL in your terminal using node command.

Copy ```const Pet = require('../src/pet');``` and return.

Create your pet by entering ```const pet = new Pet('Dal').```

Once you've done that, you can start taking care of your pet by using the methods provided in the pet.js file located in the src folder. These methods include feeding, walking, having babies, and checking on your pet's status.
